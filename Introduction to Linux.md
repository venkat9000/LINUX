1. What is Linux?
Linux is an open-source operating system based on Unix, widely used for servers, cloud computing, and embedded systems.

Key Features:
âœ” Operating System: Manages hardware and software resources.
âœ” Open Source: Free to use, modify, and distribute.
âœ” Developed in 1991 by Linus Torvalds.
âœ” Multi-User & Multi-Tasking: Many people can use the system at the same time, And the system can run many tasks (programs) at the same time too.

âœ” Case Sensitive: Treats uppercase and lowercase differently (File.txt â‰  file.txt).

2. Linux Distributions (Flavors)
A distribution (distro) is a customized version of Linux that includes the OS, package management, and additional tools.

Distro	Use Case
RedHat	Enterprise-grade, commercial support (RHEL)
Ubuntu	User-friendly, widely used for desktops/servers
CentOS	Community-supported version of RedHat
Debian	Stable, known for reliability
SUSE Linux	Enterprise use, strong in SAP environments
Other distros: Fedora, Arch Linux, Kali Linux (for penetration testing), etc.

3. Linux Directory Structure
Linux follows a hierarchical directory structure where everything starts from / (root directory).

Linux Directory Structure

Key Directories Explained
/ (Root Directory): The top-most directory that contains all files and subdirectories.
/bin - Essential binary executables (commands) like ls, cp, mv.
/sbin - System binaries used for system administration (e.g., reboot, fdisk).
/etc - System and application configuration files (e.g., /etc/passwd for user details).
/home - User home directories (/home/user1, /home/user2). Each user stores personal files here.
/dev - Represents hardware devices as files (e.g., /dev/sda for hard drives).
/root - Home directory for the root (admin) user.
/opt - Optional software packages installed manually.
/lib - Shared libraries required by system binaries (/bin, /sbin).
/proc - A virtual filesystem that provides system information (/proc/cpuinfo).
/tmp - Temporary file storage, often cleared on reboot.
ðŸ“Œ Linux Interview Questions (IQ)
ðŸ”¹ 1. What is the difference between /bin and /sbin?
ðŸ“Œ /bin (Binary Executables)
Contains basic commands that are available to all users.
These commands are essential for basic system operations.
Located in /bin, meaning they can be executed without requiring superuser privileges.
âœ… Examples:

ls - List directory contents.
cat - View file contents.
cp - Copy files.
mv - Move or rename files.
rm - Remove files.
ðŸ“Œ /sbin (System Binaries)
Contains system administration commands, primarily used by the root user.
These commands are used for system maintenance and management.
Located in /sbin, requiring root privileges (sudo) for execution.
âœ… Examples:

shutdown - Power off the system.
reboot - Restart the system.
ifconfig - Configure network interfaces.
mount - Mount filesystems.
fsck - File system consistency check.
ðŸ”¹ 2. In which directory are all external software packages installed?
ðŸ“Œ Answer: /opt
The /opt directory is used to store optional (third-party) software.
This includes software not part of the default Linux distribution.
Typically used for commercial software, large applications, or manually installed packages.
âœ… Examples of software stored in /opt:

Google Chrome (/opt/google/chrome)
VirtualBox (/opt/VirtualBox)
Custom enterprise applications
ðŸ’¡ Why /opt?

Keeps the system clean by separating non-default software from system files.
Avoids conflicts with default Linux package manager installations (/usr/bin, /usr/sbin).
Easier to manage, upgrade, and remove third-party applications.
ðŸ“Œ Summary
Directory	Purpose	Access Level	Examples
/bin	Essential user commands	All users	ls, cp, mv, rm
/sbin	System administration commands	Root user (sudo required)	shutdown, reboot, mount
/opt	External software packages	Varies (depends on software)	Google Chrome, VirtualBox
